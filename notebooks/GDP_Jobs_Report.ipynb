    "The basic idea here is to use the BEA population estimates plus CPS employment rate and hours worked trends to estimate GDP per hour of work. BLS does this process for its productivity and costs report, using much more comprehensive data, however this approximation has proven decent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hard part to this measure is getting hours worked right. All of the published measures are either too-low-frequency or don't have a broad enough definition of workers. I want to capture all workers, regardless of full-time or part-time status or of whether they work for the private sector. Also want to capture second and third jobs. As a result, I selected total actual hours worked from the CPS microdata, specifically finding the trend using x13as with default settings. Hours worked from the CPS microdata have issues around holidays falling in the reference week, and also do not capture hours worked for some important categories of labor such as self-employed persons."
