United States Treasury securities, or \textbf{treasuries}, are the asset created by federal government borrowing. The treasuries market is traditionally considered both very low risk and fairly liquid. The yield on these securities has fallen over time, from an average 10-year treasury bond annual yield of 8.5 percent in 1989 to an average of 0.62 percent in July 2020. As of March 17, 2022, the constant maturity yield for 10-year treasury bonds is 2.2 percent (see {\color{blue!70!black}\textbf{---}}), compared to 1.71 percent one year prior. 

Yields have also fallen since 1989 for shorter-duration treasuries, though shorter-duration treasuries are more acutely affected by changes in the key interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. Over the past year, yields on two-year treasuries have increased by 1.8 percentage points, as the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates. As of March 17, 2022, the annual yield on two-year treasuries is 1.94 percent (see {\color{blue!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
