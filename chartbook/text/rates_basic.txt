United States Treasury securities, or \textbf{treasuries}, are the asset created by federal government borrowing. The treasuries market is traditionally considered both very low-risk and highly liquid. The yield on these securities has fallen over time, from an average ten-year treasury bond annual yield of 8.5 percent in 1989 to an average of 0.62 percent in July 2020. As of November 10, 2022, the constant maturity yield for ten-year treasury bonds is 3.82 percent (see {\color{blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}), compared to 1.46 percent one year prior. 

Longer-term treasuries follow the same trend. In November 10, 2022, 30-year treasuries yield 4.03 percent (see {\color{green!75!blue}\textbf{---}}), compared to 8.45 percent in 1989. Over the past year, 30-year treasury yields increased 2.1 percentage points. 

 Shorter-duration treasury yield have also fallen since 1989, though shorter-duration treasuries are more acutely affected by changes in the key interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. Over the past year, two-year treasury yields have increased by 3.9 percentage points, as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates. As of November 10, 2022, the annual yield on two-year treasuries is 4.34 percent (see {\color{cyan!90!white}\textbf{---}}).
