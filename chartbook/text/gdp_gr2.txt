The swings in real GDP growth during the COVID-19 pandemic were so extreme that they make it hard to visually compare data before and after the pandemic using quarterly growth charts. As such, annual growth rates are included in the bottom left chart to make trends more visible. Additionally, the most recent four quarters are included in the bottom right chart. In the \textbf{latest data}, covering the fourth quarter of 2021, real GDP increased at an annual rate of seven percent, compared to an increase of 2.3 percent in Q3, and an increase of 6.7 percent in Q2.
