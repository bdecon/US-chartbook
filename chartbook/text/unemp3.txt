Unemployment is much more common for disadvantaged groups, with the black or African American unemployment rate typically double the white unemployment rate. A very tight labor market may have the effect of reducing racial discrimination in hiring. However, disadvantaged groups are more likely to lose jobs in a downturn. As a result, the full-employment portion of the business cycle is quite short for many people. Since February 2020, the black unemployment rate has increased by 2.8 percentage points to 8.8 percent (see {\color{green!50!teal!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
