Periods of unemployment are more common for disadvantaged groups. The black or African American unemployment rate is typically double the white unemployment rate. Employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups are more-dependent on current labor market conditions. A very tight labor market reduces racial discrimination in hiring, while disadvantaged groups are more likely to lose jobs in a downturn. Since February 2020, the black unemployment rate has decreased by 0.3 percentage point to 5.7 percent (see {\color{green!50!teal!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
