Periods of unemployment are more common for disadvantaged groups. The black or African American unemployment rate is typically double the white unemployment rate. Employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups are more-dependent on current labor market conditions. A very tight labor market reduces racial discrimination in hiring, while disadvantaged groups are more likely to lose jobs in a downturn. The black unemployment rate is currently 6.1 percent, in line with the February 2020 rate (see {\color{green!50!teal!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
