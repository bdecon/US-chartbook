Unemployment is much more common for disadvantaged groups, with the black or African American unemployment rate typically double the white unemployment rate. A very tight labor market may have the effect of reducing racial discrimination in hiring. However, disadvantaged groups are more likely to lose jobs in a downturn. As a result, the full-employment period of the business cycle is quite short for many people. Since February 2020, the black or African American unemployment rate has increased by 0.9 percentage points to 6.7 percent (see {\color{green!50!teal!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
