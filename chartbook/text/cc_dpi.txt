Consumer credit totals \$4.18 trillion US dollars on a seasonally-adjusted and annualized basis in December 2020. Over the past year, consumer credit was virtually unchanged, while after-tax income increased by 4.7 percent. As a result, the ratio of consumer credit to disposable income decreased by a total of 1.1 percentage points. In December 2020, total consumer credit is equivalent to 24.1 percent of annualized December 2020 disposable income (see {\color{green!70!blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}).
