Consumer credit totals \$4.41 trillion US dollars on a seasonally-adjusted and annualized basis in November 2021. Over the past year, consumer credit increased by 5.8 percent, while after-tax income increased by 5.8 percent. As a result, the ratio of consumer credit to disposable income was virtually unchanged. In November 2021, total consumer credit is equivalent to 24.3 percent of annualized November 2021 disposable income (see {\color{green!60!blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}).
