In the monthly measure, consumer credit totals \$4.43 trillion US dollars on a seasonally-adjusted and annualized basis in December 2021. Over the past year, consumer credit increased by 5.9 percent, while after-tax income decreased by 4.4 percent. As a result, the ratio of consumer credit to disposable income was virtually unchanged. In December 2021, total consumer credit is equivalent to 24.3 percent of annualized December 2021 disposable income (see {\color{green!60!blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}).
