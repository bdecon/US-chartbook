Consumer credit totals \$4.21 trillion US dollars on a seasonally-adjusted and annualized basis in February 2021. Over the past year, consumer credit was virtually unchanged, while after-tax income increased by 5.0 percent. As a result, the ratio of consumer credit to disposable income decreased by a total of 1.2 percentage points. In February 2021, total consumer credit is equivalent to 23.8 percent of annualized February 2021 disposable income (see {\color{green!70!blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}).
