Consumer credit totals \$4.35 trillion US dollars on a seasonally-adjusted and annualized basis in August 2021. Over the past year, consumer credit increased by 4.8 percent, while after-tax income increased by 4.5 percent. As a result, the ratio of consumer credit to disposable income was virtually unchanged. In August 2021, total consumer credit is equivalent to 24.0 percent of annualized August 2021 disposable income (see {\color{green!70!blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}).
