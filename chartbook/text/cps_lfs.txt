As of October 2019, 160.4 million people are employed (including self-employment). Labor provided within a household is not captured by GDP compilation methods (expenditures, output, or income), though household surveys offer some insight into this important category of labor. The number of people who are considered employed divided by the total population is the employment rate or employment-to-population ratio, which is 49.4 percent as of October 2019.
