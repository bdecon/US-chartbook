When investors are uncertain about the future, they will pay a premium for the insurance-like qualities of options. The CBOE volatility index, popularly known as the VIX, captures overall changes in options prices to identify the market-implied volatility in the S\&P 500 index over the following 30 days.

The latest value for the VIX is 16.9 on April 17, 2023 (see {\color{violet}\textbf{---}}), slightly below the average index value of 23.8 over the past three years, and in line with the typical index value of 17.9 since 1990. The VIX decreased by two points over the past week.
