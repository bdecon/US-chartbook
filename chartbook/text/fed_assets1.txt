In response to the collapse of the housing bubble, the Fed purchased U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Total assets held by the Federal Reserve (see {\color{blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}) increased from \$0.9 trillion in August 2008 to \$2.2 trillion in November 2008. Additional rounds of asset purchases, referred to as quantitative easing, increased the balance sheet to \$4.5 trillion by January 2014. As bonds mature they were replaced until October 2017, when the Fed allowed the size of its balance sheet to normalize. Total assets fell below \$3.8 trillion in August 2019.
