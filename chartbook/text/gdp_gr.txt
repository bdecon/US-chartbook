Changes in economic activity are commonly \href{url}{summarized} using the growth rate of real gross domestic product. As seen in the previous section, economic activity has increased fairly consistently in the US. Since 1989, \textbf{real GDP growth} has averaged 2.5 percent per year (see\cbox{red}). Real GDP growth rates were particularly high during the mid- to late-1990s, and averaged 3.8 percent per year from 1993 to 2000.

In the 2000s, the housing bubble artificially boosted GDP but then collapsed, leading to average annual GDP growth of only 1.8 percent from 2001 to 2013. Growth rates were somewhat higher from 2014 through 2019, averaging 2.3 percent per year.

In 2020, COVID-19 caused a rapid and unexpected economic shutdown, followed by monetary and fiscal stimulus. The result was large swings in quarterly GDP, particularly when quarterly growth is reported at an annual rate, as is the case for GDP in the US. In 2020 Q2, GDP decreased 31.2 percent, and in Q3 increased by 33.8 percent, by far the largest changes in recent history. Since 2020, real GDP growth has averaged 3.0 percent per year.
