Real GDP growth \href{https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product}{measures} changes in economic activity. As seen in the previous subsection, real GDP has increased steadily over the long-term. Since 1989, growth averages 2.4 percent per year (see\cbox{red}). Growth rates were relatively high during the mid- to late-1990s, averaging 3.9 percent from 1993 to 2000.

In the 2000s, the housing bubble boosted GDP but then collapsed, leading to average growth of only 1.9 percent from 2001 to 2013. Growth was slightly stronger from 2014 to 2019, averaging 2.7 percent per year.

In 2020, COVID-19 caused an economic shutdown, followed by monetary and fiscal stimulus, resulting in large swings in GDP. Annualized real GDP decreased 28.0 percent in Q2, and increased by 34.8 percent in Q3, by far the largest changes in recent history. Since 2019 Q4, real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.0 percent.
