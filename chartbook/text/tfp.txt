In 2021, labor productivity increased by 1.9 percent (see \begin{tikzpicture} \node[line width=0.3mm, circle, draw=black, scale=0.4, aspect=0.8] (d) at (0,0) {}; \end{tikzpicture}). Capital intensity subtracted 1.3 percentage points (see\cbox{violet!60!white}), and labor composition did not contribute (see\cbox{blue!60!black}). The remainder, called total factor productivity, added 3.2 percentage points (see\cbox{cyan!40!white}).
