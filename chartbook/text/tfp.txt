In 2022, labor productivity decreased by 1.7 percent (see \begin{tikzpicture} \node[line width=0.3mm, circle, draw=black, scale=0.4, aspect=0.8] (d) at (0,0) {}; \end{tikzpicture}). Capital intensity subtracted 0.4 percentage point (see \cbox{violet!60!white}), and labor composition did not contribute (see \cbox{blue!60!black}). The remainder, called total factor productivity, subtracted 1.2 percentage points (see \cbox{cyan!40!white}).
