Much of the increase in real GDP per capita over the past 30 years comes from consumer spending. Domestic consumer spending (see {\color{yellow!65!orange}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$44,255 per person in 2020 Q1, a price-adjusted increase of \$18,042 since 1989. Gross private domestic investment (see {\color{blue!70!black}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$11,013 per person in 2020 Q1, and government spending and investment (see {\color{cyan!60!white}\textbf{---}}) totals \$11,689 per person. To adjust the above to capture only domestic production, net exports (see {\color{green!60!black}\textbf{---}}), equivalent to \$-1,592 per person in 2020 Q1, are included.
