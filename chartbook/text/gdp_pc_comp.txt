Much of the increase in real GDP per capita over the past 30 years comes from consumer spending. Domestic consumer spending (see {\color{yellow!65!orange}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$39,701 per person in 2020 Q2, a price-adjusted increase of \$13,542 since 1989. Gross private domestic investment (see {\color{blue!70!black}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$9,484 per person in 2020 Q2, and government spending and investment (see {\color{cyan!60!white}\textbf{---}}) totals \$11,638 per person. Net exports equivalent to \$1,653 per person are subtracted to reflect only domestic production (see {\color{green!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
