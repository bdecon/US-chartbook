Much of the increase in real GDP per capita over the past 30 years comes from consumer spending. Domestic consumer spending (see {\color{yellow!45!orange}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$52,516 per person in 2022 Q3, a price-adjusted increase of \$23,159 since 1989. Gross private domestic investment (see {\color{blue!70!black}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$13,775 per person in 2022 Q3, and government spending and investment (see {\color{cyan!60!white}\textbf{---}}) totals \$13,426 per person. Net exports equivalent to \$2,705 per person are subtracted to reflect only domestic production (see {\color{green!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
