Much of the increase in real GDP per capita over the past 30 years comes from consumer spending. Domestic consumer spending (see {\color{yellow!45!orange}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$54,640 per person in 2023 Q2, a price-adjusted increase of \$24,508 since 1989. Gross private domestic investment (see {\color{blue!70!black}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$13,860 per person in 2023 Q2, and government spending and investment (see {\color{cyan!60!white}\textbf{---}}) totals \$13,982 per person. The trade deficit, equivalent to \$2,382 per person, is subtracted, to capture only domestic production (see {\color{green!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
