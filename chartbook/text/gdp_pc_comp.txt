Much of the increase in real GDP per capita over the past 30 years comes from consumer spending. Domestic consumer spending (see {\color{yellow!65!orange}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$48,102 per person in 2021 Q3, a price-adjusted increase of \$20,515 since 1989. Gross private domestic investment (see {\color{blue!70!black}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$12,337 per person in 2021 Q3, and government spending and investment (see {\color{cyan!60!white}\textbf{---}}) totals \$12,298 per person. Net exports equivalent to \$2,834 per person are subtracted to reflect only domestic production (see {\color{green!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
