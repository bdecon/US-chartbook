Gross private domestic investment (see {\color{blue!70!black}\textbf{---}}) is equivalent to \$13,882 per person in 2022 Q4, and government spending and investment (see {\color{cyan!60!white}\textbf{---}}) totals \$13,665 per person. Net exports equivalent to \$2,534 per person are subtracted to reflect only domestic production (see {\color{green!60!black}\textbf{---}}).
