In 2022, among the 284.3 percent of white families who own stocks, the average value of stock holdings is \$568,136. The return on these assets is a supplement to labor income and the assets themselves provide cushion against unexpected expenses. Meanwhile, black families have relatively few financial assets; only 44.1 percent of black families own stocks, with average stock holdings of \$80,400.
