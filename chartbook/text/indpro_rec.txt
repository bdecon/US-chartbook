Looking more closely at recent industrial production growth, the latest one-year growth rate, covering October 2023, is substantially below the five-year average, and slightly below the September growth rate. 

By market group, the latest decrease is driven by a decrease in consumer goods and business equipment and non-industrial supplies, and partially offset by an increase in energy materials. By industry group, the latest decrease is also driven by a decrease in nondurable manufacturing and durable manufacturing.
