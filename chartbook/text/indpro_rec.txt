Looking more closely at recent industrial production growth, the latest one-year growth rate, covering June 2023, is slightly below the five-year average, and slightly below the May growth rate. 

By market group, the latest small decrease is the result of little change across several categories. By industry group, the latest decrease is driven by a decrease in electric and gas utilities and nondurable manufacturing, and partially offset by an increase in mining.
