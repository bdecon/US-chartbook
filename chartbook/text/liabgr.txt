Since the second quarter of 2019, inflation-adjusted US debt has increased at an annualized rate of 3.7 percent, in line with the long-term rate of 3.8 percent. Over this four-year period, growth is relatively broad-based. The main contribution is an increase in federal government debt. Federal government debt contributed 2.6 percentage points to annualized growth, and nonfinancial business debt contributed 0.7 percentage point.

Over the year ending 2022 Q2, real debt increased 0.7 percent, far below the long-term average. Federal government borrowing (see\cbox{blue!70!white}) contributed one percentage point to the overall change, while the state and local government subtracted 0.2 percentage point (see\cbox{cyan!60!white}). Households and nonprofits did not contribute (see\cbox{orange!90!red}), and nonfinancial businesses did not contribute (see\cbox{green!72!black}).
