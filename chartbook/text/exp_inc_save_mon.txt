Real per capita consumer spending over the past three months compared with the previous three months shows annualized growth of two percent in November 2023. Higher income contributed 0.6 percentage point, reduced saving contributed 2.5 percentage points, and increases in other outlays subtracted 1.1 percentage points.

 Higher interest rates, which count as other outlays, can eat into consumer spending. Since the start of 2022, increases in other outlays have reduced consumer spending by 0.8 percentage point per year.
