Real per capita consumer spending over the past three months compared with the previous three months shows annualized growth of 3.4 percent in September 2023. Lower income subtracted 1.7 percentage points, reduced saving contributed six percentage points, and increases in other outlays subtracted 0.8 percentage point.

 Higher interest rates, which count as other outlays, can eat into consumer spending. Since the start of 2022, increases in other outlays have reduced consumer spending by 0.8 percentage point per year.
