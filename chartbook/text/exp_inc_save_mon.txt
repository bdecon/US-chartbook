Real per capita consumer spending over the past three months compared with the previous three months shows annualized growth of 1.9 percent in June 2024. Higher income contributed 0.6 percentage point, reduced saving contributed 1.3 percentage points, and other outlays did not contribute.

 Higher interest rates, which count as other outlays, can eat into consumer spending. Since the start of 2022, increases in other outlays have reduced consumer spending by 0.5 percentage point per year.
