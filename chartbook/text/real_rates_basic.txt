 The real yield for such treasuries with 10 years to maturity is -0.54 percent, as of February 23, 2022 (see {\color{red}\textbf{---}}), compared to -0.63 percent one month prior, on January 24. For five-year treasuries, the real yield is -1.12 percent in the latest data (see {\color{violet}\textbf{---}}), compared to -1.21 percent a month prior. Over the past year, the real yield on 10-year treasuries has increased by 0.25 percentage point, and the real yield on five-year treasuries has increased by 0.64 percentage point.
