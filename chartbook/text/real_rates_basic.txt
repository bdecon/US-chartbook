One measure of real interest rates comes from Treasury inflation-indexed securities. The yield on these securities can be a proxy for the interest rate investors would charge for treasuries, without inflation. 

As of January 17, 2024, the real yield on ten-year treasuries is 1.80 percent (see {\color{green!85!blue}\textbf{---}}), compared to 2.36 percent three months prior, on October 12, 2023. Five-year treasuries yield 1.78 percent in the latest data, and 2.46 percent three months prior, after adjusting for expected inflation (see {\color{violet!50!blue!60!white}\textbf{---}}).
