US Treasury inflation-indexed securities are used to measure real interest rates. Treasury yields in general are a good proxy for low-risk rates, and the treasury offers specific securities that have interest payments indexed to the consumer price index (CPI) rate of inflation. 

 The real yield for such treasuries with ten years to maturity is -1.02 percent, as of July 16, 2021 (see {\color{red}\textbf{---}}), compared to -0.75 percent on June 16, 2021. For a five-year maturity, the real yield is -1.73 percent in the latest data (see {\color{violet}\textbf{---}}), compared to -1.52 percent a month prior.
