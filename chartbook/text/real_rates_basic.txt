US Treasury inflation-indexed securities are used to measure real interest rates. Treasury yields in general are a good proxy for low-risk rates, and the treasury offers specific securities that have interest payments indexed to the consumer price index (CPI) rate of inflation. 

 The real yield for such treasuries with 10 years to maturity is -0.85 percent, as of March 2, 2022 (see {\color{red}\textbf{---}}), compared to -0.65 percent one month prior, on January 31. For five-year treasuries, the real yield is -1.49 percent in the latest data (see {\color{violet}\textbf{---}}), compared to -1.20 percent a month prior. Over the past year, the real yield on 10-year treasuries has decreased by 0.07 percentage point, and the real yield on five-year treasuries has increased by 0.27 percentage point.
