 The real yield for such treasuries with ten years to maturity is -0.83 percent, as of June 29, 2021 (see {\color{red}\textbf{---}}), compared to -0.84 percent on May 28, 2021. For a five-year maturity, the real yield is -1.57 percent in the latest data (see {\color{violet}\textbf{---}}), compared to -1.78 percent a month prior.
