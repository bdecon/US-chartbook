One measure of real interest rates comes from Treasury inflation-indexed securities. The yield on these securities can be a proxy for the interest rate investors would charge for treasuries, without inflation. 

As of November 8, 2023, the real yield on ten-year treasuries is 2.15 percent (see {\color{green!85!blue}\textbf{---}}), compared to 1.68 percent three months prior, on August 7. Five-year treasuries yield 2.22 percent in the latest data, and 1.87 percent three months prior, after adjusting for expected inflation (see {\color{violet!50!blue!60!white}\textbf{---}}).
