The first and most-common approach to analyzing US liabilities looks at \textbf{debt}, encompassing loans and debt securities like bonds.  This approach aggregates the debt across all nonfinancial sectorsâ€”households, businesses, and government. As of the third quarter of 2023, the total debt for the sectors stands at \$73.0 trillion, which is 264.2 percent of GDP, or \$217,437 per capita.

The second approach considers \textbf{total liabilities}, which extend beyond debt to encompass all financial commitments, such as accounts payable, tax obligations, pensions, intercompany debts, and various other liabilities. The aggregate liabilities for nonfinancial sectors reach \$97.0 trillion in 2023 Q3, or 351.3 percent of GDP.

The last approach looks at \textbf{foreign financial claims} on the US. From a net US wealth perspective, domestic liabilities to domestic creditors net out. It is therefore of interest to look what is owed to foreign creditors. Foreign financial claims on the US total \$44.5 trillion in 2023 Q3, translating to 161.3 percent of GDP, or \$132,730 per capita.
