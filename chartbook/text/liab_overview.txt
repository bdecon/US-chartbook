The first and most-common approach to analyzing US liabilities looks at \textbf{debt}, encompassing loans and debt securities like bonds.  This approach aggregates the debt across all nonfinancial sectorsâ€”households, businesses, and government. As of the second quarter of 2023, the total debt for the sectors stands at \$71.2 trillion, which is 263.3 percent of GDP, or \$212,668 per capita.

The second approach considers \textbf{total liabilities}, which extend beyond debt to encompass all financial commitments, such as accounts payable, tax obligations, pensions, intercompany debts, and various other liabilities. The aggregate liabilities for nonfinancial sectors reach \$95.9 trillion in 2023 Q2, or 354.3 percent of GDP.

The last approach looks at \textbf{foreign financial claims} on the US. From a net US wealth perspective, domestic liabilities to domestic creditors net out. It is therefore of interest to look what is owed to foreign creditors. Foreign financial claims on the US total \$45.7 trillion in 2023 Q2, translating to 169.0 percent of GDP, or \$136,550 per capita.
