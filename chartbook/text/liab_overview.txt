The first and most-common approach to analyzing US liabilities looks at \textbf{debt}, which includes loans and debt securities, such as bonds. In this approach, total debt is the sum of debt held by each nonfinancial sector of the domestic economy: households, businesses, and the government. The combined debt of US nonfinancial sectors is \$71.2 trillion in the second quarter of 2023, equivalent to 263.3 percent of GDP, or \$212,668 per capita. 

The second approach is \textbf{total liabilities}, which include debt and all other financial obligations. Other financial obligations include accounts payable, taxes payable, pension obligations, intercompany debt, and other miscellaneous liabilities. Total liabilities of nonfinancial sectors sum to \$95.9 trillion in 2023 Q2, or 354.3 percent of GDP.

The last approach looks at \textbf{foreign financial claims} on the US. From a net US wealth perspective, domestic liabilities held by domestic creditors cancel out. It is therefore of interest to look at the portion of domestic liabilities that are to foreign creditors. Foreign financial claims on the US total \$45.7 trillion in 2023 Q2, equivalent to 169.0 percent of GDP, or \$136,550 per capita.
