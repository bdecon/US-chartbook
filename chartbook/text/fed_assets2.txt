Balance sheet normalization ended in September 2019 when the Fed increased operations in overnight and term repurchase agreement (repo) markets, following a sharp increase in rates in these markets. The Fed balance sheet increased to \$4.1 trillion by December 2019. More recently, in response to worsening financial conditions, the Fed began to purchase commercial bonds and to offer currency swaps with major US trading partners. The Fed balance sheet increased from \$4.2 trillion in February 2020 to \$8.2 trillion, as of the latest data, covering July 28, 2021. The total value of Fed assets decreased by \$19 billion from the value one week prior.
