The US exported \$224.4 billion of goods and services in January 2022, following \$228.3 billion in December 2021 (see {\color{green!80!blue}\textbf{---}}). The three-month average was \$225.9 billion in January, and \$190.2 billion one year prior. Exports were \$210.7 billion per month, on average, in 2019.

Spending on imports exceeds payments received for exports, so the US runs a trade deficit. In January, the trade deficit was \$89.7 billion, following \$82.0 billion in December 2021 (see {\color{red}\textbf{---}}). Over the past three months, the trade deficit averaged \$83.9 billion, compared to an average of \$66.1 billion one year prior, during the same three months. In 2019, the trade deficit averaged \$48.0 billion per month.
