The \textbf{inventory} of new homes for sale affects housing prices. The Census Bureau \href{https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html}{report} a seasonally-adjusted total of 435,000 new houses for sale in September 2023, a decrease of 25,000 since September 2022.  At the current pace of new home sales, it would take 6.9 months to exhaust the supply of unsold homes (see {\color{red!90!black}\textbf{---}}). Current inventory levels are substantially below the year-prior supply of 9.7 months and slightly above the long-term average supply of 5.9 months.
