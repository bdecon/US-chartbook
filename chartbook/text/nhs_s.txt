The \textbf{inventory} of new homes for sale affects housing prices. The Census Bureau \href{https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html}{report} a seasonally-adjusted total of 480,000 new houses for sale in April 2024, an increase of 52,000 since April 2023.  At the current pace of new home sales, it would take 9.1 months to exhaust the supply of unsold homes (see {\color{red!90!black}\textbf{---}}). Current inventory levels are slightly above the year-prior supply of 7.5 months and far above the long-term average supply of 5.9 months.
