The \textbf{inventory} of new homes for sale affects housing prices. The Census Bureau \href{https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html}{report} a seasonally-adjusted total of 439,000 new houses for sale in October 2023, a decrease of 27,000 since October 2022.  At the current pace of new home sales, it would take 7.8 months to exhaust the supply of unsold homes (see {\color{red!90!black}\textbf{---}}). Current inventory levels are substantially below the year-prior supply of 9.7 months and substantially above the long-term average supply of 5.9 months.
