The \textbf{inventory} of new homes for sale affects housing prices. The Census Bureau \href{https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html}{report} a seasonally-adjusted total of 451,000 new houses for sale in November 2023, a decrease of 4,000 since November 2022.  At the current pace of new home sales, it would take 9.2 months to exhaust the supply of unsold homes (see {\color{red!90!black}\textbf{---}}). Current inventory levels are in line with the year-prior supply of 9.4 months and far above the long-term average supply of 5.9 months.
