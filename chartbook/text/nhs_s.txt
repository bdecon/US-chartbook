The \textbf{inventory} of new homes for sale affects housing prices. The Census Bureau \href{https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html}{report} a seasonally-adjusted total of 461,000 new houses for sale in August 2022, an increase of 87,000 since August 2021.  At the current pace of new home sales, it would take 8.1 months to exhaust the supply of unsold homes (see {\color{red!90!black}\textbf{---}}). Current inventory levels are slightly above both the year-prior supply of 6.5 months and the long-term average supply of 5.8 months.
