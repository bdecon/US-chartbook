The \textbf{inventory} of new homes for sale affects housing prices. The Census Bureau \href{https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html}{report} a seasonally-adjusted total of 476,000 new houses for sale in June 2024, an increase of 48,000 since June 2023.  At the current pace of new home sales, it would take 9.3 months to exhaust the supply of unsold homes (see {\color{red!90!black}\textbf{---}}). Current inventory levels are slightly above the year-prior supply of 7.7 months and far above the long-term average supply of 5.9 months.
