There are several \textbf{reasons for unemployment}. In April 2023, 2.6 million people, or 1.6 percent of the labor force, were unemployed from losing their job (see \cbox{red!75!orange!70!white}). An additional 0.5 percent voluntarily left a job (see \cbox{blue!72!black}). Re-entrants, people who left the labor force but are looking for a new job, comprised 1.1 percent (see \cbox{blue!70!teal!70!gray!62!white}). Lastly, 0.3 percent of the labor force were new entrants to the labor market, looking for their first job (see \cbox{purple!80!red!85!black}).
