The 20 percent of households with the least income dissave the equivalent of 36.7 percent of the US median personal income in 2020 (see {\color{violet}\textbf{---}}). This group includes people going into debt and retirees dissaving. In the same period, the top 20 percent of households save the equivalent of 223.8 percent of the median income (see {\color{blue!80!cyan!80!black}\textbf{---}}).

 The middle fifth of households by income, percentiles 40--60, saved the equivalent of 29.9 percent of the median income (see {\color{green!80!blue!85!black}\textbf{---}}). The fifth of households below the middle group, in percentiles 20--40, did not save in 2020, but dissaved less than previous years (see {\color{red!20!orange!95!black}\textbf{---}}).
