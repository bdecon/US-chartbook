In 2023 Q3, domestic holdings of foreign assets total \$32.9 trillion, which is 119.2 percent of GDP (see {\color{blue!95!violet}\textbf{---}}). These assets translate to 123.8 percent of GDP in 2023 Q2, and 128.8 percent in 2019. Domestic liabilities to the foreign sector total \$51.1 trillion, or 185.0 percent of GDP, in 2023 Q3, following 190.9 percent in 2023 Q2, and 180.2 percent in 2019 (see {\color{red}\textbf{---}}).
