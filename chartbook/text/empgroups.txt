Employment rates vary over time, but also by age, gender, and education, among other factors. Over the three months ending March 2023, the employment rate for most subgroups is about the same as it was before the pandemic. At a given point in time, employment rates tend to increase with education and tend to peak during ages 25 to 54. Within most age groups, employment rates are higher for men, though the gap has narrowed over the long-run.
