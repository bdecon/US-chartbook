\small This analysis of the United States economy begins with the most popular measure of economic activity, Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP--the seasonally-adjusted annualized value of goods and services produced in the US--was \$21,525 billion in the third quarter of 2019, compared to an inflation-adjusted equivalent of \$10,250 billion in the first quarter of 1989.\\

The US population is growing by about sixth-tenths of a percent per year. GDP per capita (see {\color{blue}\textbf{---}} ), adjusted for inflation to 2019 Q3 dollars, has increased to \$65,291 in 2019 Q3 from \$41,591 in 1989 Q1. \\
