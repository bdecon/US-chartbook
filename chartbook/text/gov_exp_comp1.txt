national defense spending fell to 15.2 percent of outlays in 2019 from 26.6 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{green!80!blue!68!black}). Discretionary non-defense spending maintained a relative stable share of spending over the period (see\cbox{green!78!black}). Net interest expense, the cost of federal borrowing, fell along with long-term interest rates, to 8.4 percent of outlays in 2019 from 14.8 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{orange!80!yellow}). 

 Offsetting the reduction in spending on interest and national defense, Medicare and Social Security now make up a larger share of federal spending, as a larger share of people are retirement age. Likewise, spending on the social safety net (means-tested benefits and Medicaid) increased as employment-to-population ratios fell and Medicaid was expanded. Medicare (see\cbox{blue!65!black}), Social Security (see\cbox{cyan!50!blue!95!white}), and the social safety net (see\cbox{cyan!95!white}) combine to comprise 54.8 percent of federal spending in 2019, compared to 34.7 percent in 1989.
