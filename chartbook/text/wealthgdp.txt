The ratio of US wealth to GDP has increased 130.8 percentage points since 1989, driven largely by increases in the market value of corporate equities and residential real estate. The market value of corporate equities was equivalent to 215.7 percent of GDP in 2023 Q3, compared to 170.2 percent in 1999--2000, during the tech bubble, and to 60.1 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{magenta!50!violet}).

The market value of domestic residential real estate was equivalent to 181.3 percent of GDP in 2023 Q3, compared to 185.0 percent in 2005--2007, during the housing bubble, and 134.2 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{green!80!blue}).

On a net basis, all other US wealth is equivalent to 116.8 percent of GDP in 2023 Q3 and 188.7 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{cyan!35!white}).
