The ratio of US wealth to GDP has increased 133.7 percentage points since 1989, driven largely by increases in the market value of corporate equities and residential real estate. The market value of corporate equities was equivalent to a 2.17 multiple of GDP in 2023 Q1, compared to 1.70 in 1999--2000, during the tech bubble, and to 0.60 in 1989 (see \cbox{magenta!50!violet}). The market value of domestic residential real estate was equivalent to a 1.72 multiple of GDP in 2023 Q1, compared to 1.85 in 2005--2007, during the housing bubble, and 1.34 in 1989 (see \cbox{green!80!blue}).

On a net basis, all other US wealth is equivalent to a 1.27 multiple of GDP in 2023 Q1 and a 1.88 multiple in 1989 (see \cbox{cyan!35!white}). The other category includes tangible assets of noncorporate businesses and governments, and domestic financial claims on foreign assets. The category also subtracts foreign financial claims on US assets, for example foreign holdings of US corporate equities and Treasury bonds.
