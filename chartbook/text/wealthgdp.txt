The ratio of US wealth to GDP has increased 133.7 percentage points since 1989, driven largely by increases in the market value of corporate equities and residential real estate. The market value of corporate equities was equivalent to 217.4 percent of GDP in 2023 Q1, compared to 170.0 percent in 1999--2000, during the tech bubble, and to 60.1 percent in 1989 (see \cbox{magenta!50!violet}).

The market value of domestic residential real estate was equivalent to 171.7 percent of GDP in 2023 Q1, compared to 185.1 percent in 2005--2007, during the housing bubble, and 134.2 percent in 1989 (see \cbox{green!80!blue}).

On a net basis, all other US wealth is equivalent to 127.4 percent of GDP in 2023 Q1 and 188.4 percent in 1989 (see \cbox{cyan!35!white}). The other category includes tangible assets of noncorporate businesses and governments, and domestic financial claims on foreign assets. The category also subtracts foreign financial claims on US assets, for example foreign holdings of US corporate equities and Treasury bonds.
