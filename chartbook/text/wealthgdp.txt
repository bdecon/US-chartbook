The market value of corporate equities was equivalent to 236.4 percent of GDP in 2023 Q4, compared to 170.2 percent in 1999--2000, during the tech bubble, and to 60.1 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{magenta!50!violet}).

The market value of domestic residential real estate was equivalent to 175.6 percent of GDP in 2023 Q4, compared to 185.0 percent in 2005--2007, during the housing bubble, and 134.2 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{green!80!blue}).

On a net basis, all other US wealth is equivalent to 104.8 percent of GDP in 2023 Q4 and 188.7 percent in 1989 (see\cbox{cyan!35!white}).
