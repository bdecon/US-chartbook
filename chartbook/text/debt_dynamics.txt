In 2021, the debt to GDP ratio decreased by 3.6 percentage points (see \begin{tikzpicture} \node[line width=0.3mm, circle, draw=black, scale=0.4, aspect=0.8] (d) at (0,0) {}; \end{tikzpicture}). The primary balance added 9.7 percentage points to the debt to GDP ratio (see\cbox{orange!60!yellow!86!white}), economic growth subtracted 6.2 percentage points (see\cbox{violet!80!white}), and real interest rates subtracted 2.3 percentage points (see\cbox{green!80!yellow!68!black}). These combined factors were greater than the actual change in liabilities; the adjustment to reconcile stocks and flows subtracted 4.9 percentage points (see\cbox{blue!90!cyan!78!white}).
