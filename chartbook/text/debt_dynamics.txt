In 2022, the debt to GDP ratio decreased by 3.1 percentage points (see \begin{tikzpicture} \node[line width=0.3mm, circle, draw=black, scale=0.4, aspect=0.8] (d) at (0,0) {}; \end{tikzpicture}). The primary balance added 1.1 percentage points to the debt to GDP ratio (see \cbox{orange!60!yellow!86!white}), economic growth subtracted 2.1 percentage points (see \cbox{violet!80!white}), and real interest rates subtracted 4.1 percentage points (see \cbox{green!80!yellow!68!black}). These combined factors were less than the actual change in liabilities; the adjustment to reconcile stocks and flows added 2.1 percentage points (see \cbox{blue!90!cyan!78!white}).
