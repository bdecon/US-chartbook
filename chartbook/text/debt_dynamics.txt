In 2022, the debt to GDP ratio decreased by 2.9 percentage points (see \begin{tikzpicture} \node[line width=0.3mm, circle, draw=black, scale=0.4, aspect=0.8] (d) at (0,0) {}; \end{tikzpicture}). The primary balance added 1.3 percentage points to the debt to GDP ratio (see\cbox{blue!90!cyan!82!white}), economic growth subtracted 1.9 percentage points (see\cbox{violet!85!black}), and real interest rates subtracted 4.1 percentage points (see\cbox{green!80!yellow!88!black}). These combined factors were less than the actual change in liabilities; the adjustment to reconcile stocks and flows added 1.8 percentage points (see\cbox{cyan!16!white}).
