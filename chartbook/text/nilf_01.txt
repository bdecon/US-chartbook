From March 2001 to the latest available twelve months of data, ending August 2021, an additional 3.6 percent of the age 18--64 population left the labor force. Changes in the demographic composition of the population affect the rate of participation. For example, the larger-than-normal population cohort born after World War II is reaching retirement age in this period. Changes in the age and sex distribution explain 1.1 percentage points of the cumulative decrease since March 2001 (see {\color{violet!80!purple}\textbf{---}}). 

Additionally, young people are staying in school longer, on average, reducing the age 18--64 labor force by 1.6 percent (see {\color{cyan}\textbf{---}}). Disability and illness reduce the labor force by another 0.6 percent (see {\color{green!80!blue}\textbf{---}}). Less retirement among those age 18--64 increases the labor force by 0.7 percent, over the period (see {\color{orange}\textbf{---}}).
