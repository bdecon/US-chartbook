From March 2001 to the latest available month, February 2020, an additional 2.4 percent of the age 18--64 population left the labor force. The larger-than-normal population cohort born after World War II is reaching retirement age in this period. Such demographic effects explain 1.2 percentage points of the cumulative decrease. Additionally, young people are staying in school longer, on average, reducing the age 18--64 labor force by 1.2 percent. Disability or illness reduce the labor force by another 0.7 percent. Less retirement among those age 18--64 increases the labor force by 0.8 percent.
