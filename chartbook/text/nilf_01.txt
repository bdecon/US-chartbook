From March 2001 to September 2023, a cumulative total of 2.1 percent of the age 18 to 64 population left the labor force. Changes in the demographic composition of the population explain some of the change. For example, the larger-than-normal population cohort born after World War II is reaching retirement age in this period. Changes in the age and sex distribution within the age group explain 1.1 percentage points of the cumulative decrease in participation since March 2001 (see {\color{violet!80!purple}\textbf{---}}). 

Additionally, young people are staying in school longer, on average, reducing the age 18 to 64 labor force by 1.5 percent (see {\color{cyan}\textbf{---}}). Disability and illness reduce the labor force by another 0.4 percent (see {\color{green!80!blue}\textbf{---}}). Less retirement among those age 18 to 64 increases participation by 0.7 percent, over the period (see {\color{orange}\textbf{---}}).
