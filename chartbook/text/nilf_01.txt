From March 2001 to October 2023, a cumulative total of 2.0 percent of the age 18 to 64 population left the labor force. Demographic shifts partially account for this change. Notably, the sizable post-World War II birth cohort has been entering retirement age during this timeframe. Changes in the age and sex distribution within the age group explain 1.1 percentage points of the cumulative decrease in participation since March 2001 (see {\color{violet!80!purple}\textbf{---}}). 

Additionally, young people are staying in school longer, on average, reducing the age 18 to 64 labor force by 1.5 percent (see {\color{cyan}\textbf{---}}). Disability and illness reduce the labor force by another 0.4 percent (see {\color{green!80!blue}\textbf{---}}). Less retirement among those age 18 to 64 increases participation by 0.7 percent, over the period (see {\color{orange}\textbf{---}}).
