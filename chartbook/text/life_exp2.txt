Life expectancy for men is 73.1 years in 2021, compared to 76.5 years in 2014 and 71.7 years in 1989 (see {\color{purple}\textbf{---}}). Women born in 2021 are expected to live 79.1 years, based on current mortality rates, compared to estimates of 81.3 years for 2014 and 78.5 years for 1989 (see {\color{blue!80!black}\textbf{---}}).
