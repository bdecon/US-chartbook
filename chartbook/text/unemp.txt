Unemployment is currently very low. BLS \href{https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm}{reports} 5.8 million unemployed persons in February 2020, and an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent. However, unemployment is much higher for disadvantaged groups, with the black or African American unemployment rate typically double the white unemployment rate. A very tight labor market may have the effect of reducing racial discrimination in hiring. Over the past year, the black or African American unemployment rate has fallen by 1.1 percentage points to 5.8 percent.
