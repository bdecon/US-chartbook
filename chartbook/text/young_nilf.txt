From 1994 to 2000, labor force participation among young people increased slightly. Following the recession of 2001, and carrying through the great recession, participation rates dropped sharply. From 2000 to 2014, labor force non-participation increased from 28.2 percent to 39.3 percent for 19 to 21 year olds and from 19.3 percent to 24.6 percent for 22 to 24 year olds (see {\color{orange!90!yellow}\textbf{---}}). The overall increase is nearly entirely accounted for by increased college enrollment (see {\color{blue!50!cyan}\textbf{---}}).

By February 2020, the labor market had improved and the annual non-participation rate was 38.3 percent for 19 to 21 year olds and 22.9 percent for 22 to 24 year olds. In the latest data, covering the 12 months ending October 2022, the rate of non-participation is 39.0 percent for 19 to 21 year olds and 24.1 percent for 22 to 24 year olds.
