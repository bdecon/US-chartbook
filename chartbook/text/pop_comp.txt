Population growth comes from two sources, natural increases (births minus deaths) and net migration. In the latest estimate, the US population added 392,700 people over the year ending July 2021. There were a total of 3.58 million births (see {\color{green!90!black}\textbf{---}}), and 3.43 million deaths (see {\color{orange!80!red}\textbf{---}}), resulting in a natural increase of 148,000 people (see \begin{tikzpicture}\draw [pattern=crosshatch, pattern color=cyan!80!blue, draw=cyan!80!blue](0,0) rectangle (.2,.2); \end{tikzpicture}). In the same period, net migration from abroad increased the resident population by 244,600 people (see\cbox{blue!75!black}). For comparison, in 1989, there were 3.91 million births, 2.17 million deaths, and 578,200 net migrants to the US.
