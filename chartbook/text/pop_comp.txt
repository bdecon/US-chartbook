Population growth comes from two sources, natural increases (births minus deaths) and net migration. In the latest estimate, the US added 1,643,500 people over the year ending July 2023, a population growth rate of 0.1 percent. There were a total of 3.65 million births (see {\color{green!90!black}\textbf{---}}), and 3.15 million deaths (see {\color{orange!80!red}\textbf{---}}), resulting in a natural increase of 504,500 people (see \begin{tikzpicture}\draw [pattern=crosshatch, pattern color=cyan!80!blue, draw=cyan!80!blue](0,0) rectangle (.2,.2); \end{tikzpicture}). In the same period, net migration from abroad increased the resident population by 1,139,000 people (see\cbox{blue!75!black}). For comparison, in 1989, there were 3.91 million births, 2.17 million deaths, and 578,200 net migrants to the US.
